        <div><p>I was very impressed with the design of mr.stephen gacheru personal website design.
          This website design is very simple but still attractiv.The background and text color perfectly
          matches. Color,performance and loading speed of the website matters a lot when promoting you
          skill through your site. This site uses minimum multimedia item and most of the content are
          in textual form which make easy to load in any browser with minimum bandwidth . with multiple
          navigation bar at the buttom of the page and a hamburger menu at left top corner. It is easy to
          look around in the site. The site is responsive which help me imagine and design my responsive design
          according to current design practices.</p>

        <p>The second site that inspire me was of me.adam hartwig. This is also mostly
          text base which is also a key component of any reliable website in today's date.
          Another aspect to look after tranformed in it's own time and there are many slides
          of section part.Although this has so many transistion and animation. The response
          time of the site is good and run smooth in all browser.

        <p> Web designing been always interesting but at
          challenging topic for me. Before starting this module.
          I just had little knowledge of web designing and development.I was worried it is going to be hard but
          Module start from beginning so, catching up with
          the class was not that much of a problem.
        </p>

        <p>First two week were all about github. I get to know about version control
          and why it is important to learn. I learn to create github repository and
          perform pull,push,clone and commit operation using terminal. Learning to use html tag and getting familar with syntax was first prority.
          Descovering CSS was one of the best experience throughout this module. first i learn about
          basic css properties like backgound, color ,fonts and many more. After that next step always
          positioning using Float structure. Float was a bit confusing at first but after a while i start
          to understand how positioning work in html and css. After float comes flex which make positioning
          relative object too easy to understand and impliment. i learn to use flex and many flex porperties
          which give web designing a new approach for me. I get to know flex is new technique and is replacing
          float.
        </p>
        <p>One of the most important topic in this module was CSS3. CSS3 is very important to make intractive
        design and to follow google material design. which is the best design practice now a days. i use CSS3
        properties like border radius, box shadow, text shadow, transistion and transformation. I learn to
        make html form and validate them using javascript. Last lecture of a module is about javascript and why
        we use it. I am excited to learn javascript in detail in my next module. </p>

      <h1>WireFrame for Desktop Browser</h1>
      <p>These are some wireframes i have created before moving to the implimentation part of the program.</p>
      <h2>Index page</h2>

        <img class="images" src="../images/wireframes/index-desktop.png" alt="index wireframe for desktop"></img>
      </div>

      </div>
      <h2>Contact page</h2>
      <div class="images_division">

      <h2>Social Page</h2>
      <div class="images_division">
        <img class="images" src="../images/wireframes/social-desktop.png" alt="social wireframe for desktop"></img>
      </div>

      <h1>WireFrame for mobile browers</h1>
      <p>Most of the people surf internet using there mobile phones.So, it is essential
        to develope a site which is accessible through small screen devices too.These are some wireframes
        used for responsive mobile devices</p>
    <h2>Index page</h2>
      <div class="images_division">
        <img class="images-mobile" src="../images/wireframes/index-mobile.png" alt="index wireframe for mobile"></img>
      </div>
      <h2>About me page</h2>
      <div class="images_division">
        <img class="images-mobile" src="../images/wireframes/aboutme-mobile.png" alt="about me wireframe for mobile"></img>
      </div>
      <h2>Contact page</h2>
      <div class="images_division">
        <img class="images-mobile" src="../images/wireframes/contact-mobile.png" alt="contact wireframe for mobile"></img>
      </div>
      <h2>CV page</h2>

      </div>
      <h1>Implimentation</h1>
        <p>All six pages including module_gp are build using HTML and CSS.Model_gp contain
          report of the final product.Flex is used in all pages because flex is taking
          over float and will be irrelevant soon. Index.html is a landing page of the websites
          and will be first access by github. About me,Contact,CV and Social open in same tab as
          a previous page and module_gp will open in new tab. All other pages have exact same
          header and footer as index page except Module_gp.Navigation bar, Map and form
          validation uses javascript. Most of the javascript code are taken from w3school. i will
          be giving reference in code document.Following are the screenshots of
          final product. Screen shot of Desktop browser and Mobile browser are together followed
          by validation proof and other relevant tests.
          <h2>Home Page</h2>
