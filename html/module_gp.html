        <div><p>I was very impressed with the design of mr.stephen gacheru personal website design.
          This website design is very simple but still attractiv.The background and text color perfectly
          matches. Color,performance and loading speed of the website matters a lot when promoting you
          skill through your site. This site uses minimum multimedia item and most of the content are
          in textual form which make easy to load in any browser with minimum bandwidth . with multiple
          navigation bar at the buttom of the page and a hamburger menu at left top corner. It is easy to
          look around in the site. The site is responsive which help me imagine and design my responsive design
          according to current design practices.</p>

        <p>The second site that inspire me was of me.adam hartwig. This is also mostly
          text base which is also a key component of any reliable website in today's date.
          Another aspect to look after tranformed in it's own time and there are many slides
          of section part.Although this has so many transistion and animation. The response
          time of the site is good and run smooth in all browser.

        <p> Web designing been always interesting but at
          challenging topic for me. Before starting this module
          I just had little knowledge of web designing and development.
          Module start from beginning so, catching up with
          the class was not that much of a problem.
